## Part 1: Admin User Manual

The **Admin Panel** is designed for librarians to manage the entire library operation, including the catalog, user accounts, circulation, and system settings.

### 1. Access and Login
To access the administrative dashboard, navigate to the admin login URL in your browser.

**Login Credentials**
Enter your assigned username and password. If you are setting this up for the first time, use the default super admin credentials:
* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `password`

> **Note:** It is highly recommended to change the default password immediately after your first login for security purposes.

### 2. Dashboard Overview
Upon successful login, you will be greeted by the **Dashboard**. This central hub provides real-time statistics about the library's status.

**Key Metrics Displayed:**
* **Total Books:** The count of unique titles in the catalog.
* **Total Members:** The number of active student/faculty accounts.
* **Books Issued:** The number of books currently borrowed.
* **Overdue Books:** A count of books that have exceeded their return date.

    * *Title*
    * *Author*
    * *ISBN*
    * *Category*

3.  Specify the **Total Quantity**. The system will automatically generate unique `Book UIDs` for every copy (e.g., `LMS/BOOK/00001-1`).

#### Editing and Deleting

#### Returning a Book

2.  Enter the **Book UID**.
3.  The system will calculate fines automatically based on the return date.
    * If the book is **Overdue**, the fine amount will be displayed.
    * You must collect the fine payment (Cash/Card) to complete the return process.

### 5. Member Management
Administrators can manage user accounts from the **Members** page.

* **Add Member:** Create new accounts for students or faculty. You will need to assign a *Student ID*, *Name*, and *Department*.
* **Status:** You can toggle a member's status between `Active` and `Inactive`. Inactive members cannot borrow books.
